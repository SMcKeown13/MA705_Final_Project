# MA705_Final_Project
Summary of Army Offense

My goal for this project was to create an app deployed on Heroku that would be able to show some key charts and data points for the Army football offense. My family has been 
going to West Point football games since the 1970's and have been season ticket holders for years. For the past several years, the team has performed much better under Jeff
Monken and his triple-option offense. This style of offense is unique in that it is much more run centric than pass centric. The charts and figures in this dashboard are designed
to understand more about the play-calling and the success of the offense in general.


Files "MA Final Project", "ArmyGameDfCreation", and "ArmyDriveCleanUp" are used to both gather the data from API's for the three dataframes used in the app. Also, these files
contain a lot of code that was used in testing and cleaning the dataframes and was later added to the final app.

The file "Final_Project_App" contains all the code used to deploy the app

"requirements.txt" has all of the packages used in the code
"Procfile" is needed to run the app on Heroku
There are two picture files used on the app, they are also in this repository
