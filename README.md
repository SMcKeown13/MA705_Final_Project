# MA705_Final_Project
Summary of Army Offense

The purpose of this project was to create a dashboard that could help people better understand the statistics behind the Army football team and their unique offense under Jeff
Monken. They run the triple-option offense which focuses on the run more than pass, something that is quite uncommon in college football. The charts and figures in the dashboard
are supposed to provide the insight into the play selection and the success of the offense over the years as the team has gotten better. 

This repository contains all related files to the dashboard and app on Heroku including the code to the app, the code use to get the data from the API, and the csv's created from
that code.
